=head1 NAME
 
maillogs - A log file post-processer for multilog log files


=head1 SYNOPSIS
 
  maillogs <protocol> [-r] [-v]

   <protocol> is one of: 
   
          smtp - report SMTP AUTH attempts and successes
           rbl - report RBL blocks
          send - report qmail-send counters
          pop3 - report pop3 counters
          imap - report imap counters
  spamassassin - report spamassassin counters
  qmailscanner - report qmailscanner counters
       webmail - count webmail authentications
      
     yesterday - mail an activity report to the admin


=head1 USAGE

Maillogs is used in two different ways. 

=over

=item Log Processor 

In its simplest form, you just run maillogs and telling it which type of logs you want want to process. It parses the log files in real time, updates the counter files it maintains, and prints out the counters. 

=item multilog post-processer 

The multilog program (http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/multilog.html) has a poorly documented ability to run a postprocessor on logs after they reach a predetermined size (or are otherwise triggered). 

This script is that postprocessor. To use maillogs as a post-processor, you must rename it to the the type of logs that it is processing. This is currently one of: pop3log, smtplog, sendlog. When run in this fashion, qmail will pipe its logs to multilog and once they reach the size determined in the log/run file, multilog will run the post-processing command. 

When run as a post-processor, multilogs does not print anything, it simply processes through the logs and updates the counters. An optional feature is to have maillogs pipe the logs to cronolog which can archive your logs for you. This is the default behaviour.

=back


=head1 DESCRIPTION

A script that:

   processes mail logs and generates counters from them.
   maintains counters for mail logs
   functions as a postprocessor for multilog
   
Currently handles log counting of the following types:

	qmail mail delivery (send)

	qmail-pop3d         (pop3)
	courier pop3d       (pop3)
	courier pop3dssl    (pop3)

	courier imapd       (imap)
	courier imapdssl    (imap)

	vpopmail smtp-auth  (smtp)

	sqwebmail           (webmail)
	squirrelmail        (webmail)

	rblsmtpd            (rbl)

	spamasssassin       (spamassassin)
	qmailscanner        (qmailscanner)


=head2 MOTIVATION

I have "farms" of mail servers that share a hostname. I needed a way to collect the logs from all the servers and process them. maillogs is a piece of that puzzle that does several things. 

    takes qmail log files (/var/log/mail/[send|smtp|pop3]/current) 
    parses them, saving counts of the logs active
    and stores them in counter files.


=over 8

=item rblsmtpd 

For smtp logs we count denied RBL connections, spam and virus denials, invalid message formats, and other forms of SMTP phase rejection.


=item qmail-send

we log a slew of message statistics that are best understood by looking at the RRDutil graphs that "show" them.. 


=item authentication

For pop3, IMAP, webmail, and SMTP-AUTH, we count the number of 
connections and the number of successful logins.


=back

Counters are written to files in /var/log/mail/counters/ by default.
You can alter the locations of the logs files by editing the 
toaster.conf file included with this script. That file should be
installed in /usr/local/etc.


=head2	DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS


=over 8

=item * 

Counters will be polled via SNMP. Script must be able to return counts nearly instantly, even when dealing with HUGE logs.

=item * 

Must work with multilog and syslog logging formats


=item * 

Outputs data in a format suitable for polling via SNMP


=item * 

Simple configuration


=item * 

Fail safe, errors must be noticed and reported but not fatal

=back


=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
 
Options are available in toaster.conf that govern the options available in maillogs. 


=head1 INSTALLATION

Installation is automatic when you install Mail-Toaster. The latest version can be downloaded from http://mail-toaster.org/


=head1 DIAGNOSTICS
 
If the output of maillogs is not what you expect, you can run it in verbose mode to see status messages and debug logging. 


=head2 COMMON USAGE MISTAKES
